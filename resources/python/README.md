# Python Hints

We highly recommend you do this in your core track language and framework.

* It will help shake the rust off.
* You'll likely have better-looking and speedier results.
* It will be far easier to demo as part of a portfolio.
* It will take you less time to shake the rust off than it will for you to
  learn a Python graphics framework.

But if you insist, you might check out:

* [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
* [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow)
* [PySDL2](https://pypi.org/project/PySDL2/)
* [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/)

Out of all those, tkinter with Pillow will be the easiest to do a GUI in, but
it's going to not look so hot.
